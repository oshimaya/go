# NetBSD specific changes
## HEAD

    see also system header include/arm/cdefs.h.
- all
  * remove original change  for EABI padding in src/runtime/defs1_netbsd_arm.go
    and  src/cmd/link/internal/ld/elf.go because thease have been merged in
    upstream. (20161028)

  * Import upstram changes that is pagesize become to variable from constant for all OS and arch, so remove original code  for getting pagesize when netbsd only.
## 1.7.1

- all
  * Change NCPU to NCPUONLINE in ncpus for real number of active cores.

## 1.6 or before
- arm
  * Change to EABI syscall param, insert padding when 64bit alignment
  * Change default round size to 64k (0x10000),which is the same as system default linker.
- amd64
  * Change default round size to 2G (0x200000),which is the same as system default linker.
- all
  * Change PhysPageSize to variable because PageSize is not constant, it is valiable by kernel environment.
